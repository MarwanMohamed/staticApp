                    <p>Organizing any event can be stressful, but the process is far easier if you know youâ€™re covered
                        against the financial risks of something going wrong. Special event insurance can give you that
                        peace of mind and let you concentrate on making it a success.</p>

                    <h3>Required by most event venues.</h3>
                    <p>liability coverage, which protects against any claims you face for property damage or injury
                        related to the event. This could include injuries to venue staff or guests at the event.
                        Liability coverage is often required by venues.</p>
