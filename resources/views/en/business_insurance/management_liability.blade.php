                    <p>Management Liability Insurance gives you peace of mind and confidence to grow your business,
                        knowing that your personal assets are protected against legal liabilities brought against you
                        personally through managing a business.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Claims can be made against you by employees, competitors, shareholders, and clients, and if you
                        donâ€™t have the right cover you could potentially lose everything (not only your business but
                        also personal and family assets).</p>
