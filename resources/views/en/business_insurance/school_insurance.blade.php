                    <h3>What insurance coverage does your school need?</h3>
                    <p>Schools need insurance for obvious things, such as the building, the desks, and the educational
                        equipment. Beyond that, schools also need to insure their faculty and staff, their reputation,
                        and their ability to continue to educate students. Business insurance isn’t one size fits all,
                        and when it comes to educational facilities and schools, insuring them goes beyond traditional
                        business policies. Here are some examples of what a specialized school insurance policy may
                        cover:</p>
                    <hr>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Business Auto</li>
                        <li>Commercial Property</li>
                        <li>General Liability</li>
                        <li>Commercial Umbrella</li>
                        <li>Workers’ Compensation</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
