                    <h3>Directors and Officers Liability Insurance</h3>
                    <p>Directors and officer’s liability insurance covers directors and officers for claims made against
                        them while serving on a board of directors and/or as an officer. We’ll work with you to protect
                        your organization’s greatest asset: your senior leadership.</p>

                    <h3>Protection from bad business decisions.</h3>
                    <p>Directors and senior officers in a business are paid to make big decisions, but if those
                        decisions are wrong, things can get very costly. Directors and officers (D&O) liability
                        insurance covers the costs of settling claims for damages that result from poor decisions.
                        Usually, D&O policies cover costs relating to wrongful decisions, but not those decisions that
                        are classed as criminal acts or that are designed to personally benefit the director.</p>
