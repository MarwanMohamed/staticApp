                    <p>Anyone who owns or operates a yacht, boat or other marine craft has to ensure that you are
                        covered for everything, which is why Boat and Pleasure craft insurance is a necessity. It covers
                        you for loss, damage or injury to your marine craft and its occupants, as well as any costs you
                        may incur to third parties through accidental damage.</p>
